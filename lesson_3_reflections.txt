When would you want to create a remote repository rather then keeping all your work locally?
I would create a remote repository to share with others or to make available to myself but with access from another computer

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
Push command operates on branches, so in order to have control about what to pulling, it's preferable to pull changes manually
