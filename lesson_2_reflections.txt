How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

a working directory and the repository from the point of view of file transitions.
With that in mind, a staging area gives you the hability to revert files, or keep track
of files till you finally decide to commit to the repository.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
using DIFF command and all it's variant argument you can compare the current state of an object
