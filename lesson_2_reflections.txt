What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It creates a hidden folder called .git in a folder defined as a new git repository. 
It contains many metadata and objects related to new repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
A staging area represent a snapshot of files which has not yet being committed. It's in between
a working directory and the repository from the point of view of file transitions.
With that in mind, a staging area gives you the hability to revert files, or keep track
of files till you finally decide to commit to the repository.
